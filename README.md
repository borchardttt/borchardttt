## About Me  
Apart from being a developer, I am also a video game enthusiast, and I love to play Soccer and Basketball. When I am not coding or playing video games, I enjoy watching sports and spending time with my girlfriend, my friends, and family.  

If you would like to connect with me, feel free to send me a message here on GitHub. I am always interested in networking with other developers and learning new things in the field.
